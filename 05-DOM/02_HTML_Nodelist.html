<!-- IMP: You can check the methods of an object by creating it in console of the browser -->

<!-- NOTE: In js .innerText gives the text that is visible on the webpage while .textContent gives all the text that is inside that tag -->
<!-- NOTE: In js .innerHTML gives the complete html inside a tag -->
<!-- NOTE: In js .querySelector we can select something by it's id, class, tag, or anything thorugh which we can select that in css.-->
<!-- NOTE: In js .querySelector only selects the first matching result -->
<!-- IMP: Example for .querySelector :- document.querySelector("#title") => for selecting tag with id title -->
<!-- IMP: Similarly for class:- .bg-black, for tag name:- input[type='password'], for first child of p:- p:first-child -->
<!-- NOTE: In js .querySelectorAll selects all the tags with the specified query and returns a nodelist object which is like array(but not actual array) and also have a attribute of forEach -->
<!-- NOTE: In js to change the properties to individual elements of nodelist we have to use indexing even when we have only one element in it -->
<!-- NOTE: In js to change properties of every element we have to use forEach -->
<!-- NOTE: In js .getElementByClassName returns a HTMLCollection object which is also like array but don't have any method like forEach -->
<!-- NOTE: In js to convert the HTMLCollection into an array use have to convert it into an array -->
<!-- IMP: Array.from(HTMLCollection or NodeList) can be used to convert a HTMLCollection or NodeList into an array-->
